# tap-mssql
An python wrapper of singer-io/tap-mssql

the code inside the tap-mssql code is actually a clone of the singer-io/tap-mssql.

Wrote this to test Meltano with sqlserver extractor

You need a java/clojure environment set correctlyo for this to work

for installing:

```
python setup.py install
```

and then run like any other tap. Also you should use a virtual environment for this.
